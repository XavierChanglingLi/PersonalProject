This project simulate the social movement within a community given a certain radius and a rule that the agent will settle down when it is within the radius of a certain number of other agents. It is inspired by Growing Artificial Societies by Epstein and Axtell where computational modeling is used to examine self-organizing societies.
The implementation os based on the linked list data structure which is node based and used to store each agent.

Several models are created to represent agents with different features. The following image is an example of running social agent model.
