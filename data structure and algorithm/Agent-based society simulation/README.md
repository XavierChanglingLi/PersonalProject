This project simulate the social movement within a community given a certain radius and a rule that the agent will settle down when it is within the radius of a certain number of other agents. It is inspired by Growing Artificial Societies by Epstein and Axtell where computational modeling is used to examine self-organizing societies.
The implementation os based on the linked list data structure which is node based and used to store each agent.
To run the simulation:

Compile: javac Simulation.java
Run: java Simulation
