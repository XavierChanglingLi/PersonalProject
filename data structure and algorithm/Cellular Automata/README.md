This project simulate the Conway's Game of Life which is a version of cellular automata. It follows certain rules to update each cell's life state and thus forms certain pattern. 
The implementation uses 2D array to create the grid where the cells are located. The simulation uses JFrame to display the animation. 

To run the simulation:
Compile: javac LifeSimulation.java
Run: java LifeSimulation 
<number of rows> 
<number of columns> 
<number of iteration>
<density in decimal>
