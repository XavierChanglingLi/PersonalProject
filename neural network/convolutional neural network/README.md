This project implements convolutional neural network. It includes a input convolutional layer, a 2x2 max pooling layer, a dense layer with relu activation function, an output layer with softmax activation function.
The layers and activation functions can be adjusted accordingly. Different types of optimizer for the weights including SGD, SGD-M and Adam are implemented as well.
